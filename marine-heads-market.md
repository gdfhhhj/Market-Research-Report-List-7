<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Heads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cassette Toilets</li><li>Pump - Out Toilets</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The marine heads market includes two primary types of toilets: cassette toilets and pump-out toilets. Cassette toilets are compact, portable systems that feature a removable waste tank, allowing for easy disposal without a direct connection to a marine sewage system. In contrast, pump-out toilets are plumbed units that store waste in an onboard tank, which must be periodically pumped out at designated facilities. Both types cater to the needs of boaters by providing efficient waste management solutions onboard.</p></p>
