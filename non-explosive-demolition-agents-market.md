<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-Explosive Demolition Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type I</li><li>Type II</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-Explosive Demolition Agents are categorized into two main types: Type I and Type II. Type I agents typically consist of powdered products that require water activation, expanding as they hydrate, leading to controlled cracking of concrete. Type II agents, on the other hand, are more advanced formulations that can work effectively with less water and have enhanced properties for deeper penetration and faster action. Both types are eco-friendly and provide safer alternatives to traditional explosive demolition methods.</p></p>
