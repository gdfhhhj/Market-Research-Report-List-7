<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Casing Scraper Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Rotational</li><li>Rotational</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The casing scraper market is segmented into two main types: non-rotational and rotational. Non-rotational casing scrapers operate by using a stationary mechanism to remove debris and scale from the wellbore, often relying on the movement of the well itself. In contrast, rotational casing scrapers utilize a rotating action to effectively clean and prepare casing surfaces, enhancing efficiency in well maintenance. Both types serve critical roles in ensuring optimal well performance and prolonging the lifespan of oil and gas infrastructure.</p></p>
