<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pet Imaging X-ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PET imaging X-ray flat panel detector market is segmented into two main types: indirect conversion and direct conversion. Indirect conversion detectors utilize a scintillator to absorb X-rays and emit light, which is then converted into electrical signals by a sensor, providing excellent image quality and efficiency. In contrast, direct conversion detectors convert X-rays directly into electrical signals without an intermediate step, offering higher spatial resolution and sensitivity. Both technologies play crucial roles in enhancing imaging capabilities for medical diagnostics.</p></p>
