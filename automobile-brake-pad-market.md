<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automobile Brake Pad Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-asbestos Organic Brake Pads</li><li>Low Metallic NAO Brake Pads</li><li>Semi Metallic Brake Pads</li><li>Ceramic Brake Pads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automobile brake pad market includes various types, each with distinct characteristics. Non-asbestos organic (NAO) brake pads are eco-friendly, made from fibers like glass or rubber, offering quiet operation but moderate durability. Low-metallic NAO pads contain small metal amounts, enhancing heat dissipation and performance but may produce more noise and dust. Semi-metallic pads, with higher metal content, provide excellent braking and heat resistance but are noisier. Ceramic brake pads, made from ceramic fibers, deliver superior performance, low noise, and minimal dust but are costlier.</p></p>
