<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Oxygen Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive Ventilator</li><li>Noninvasive Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oxygen ventilator market comprises two primary types: invasive and noninvasive ventilators. Invasive ventilators require the insertion of a tube into the patient's airway, providing direct support for breathing in critical conditions, often seen in intensive care units. In contrast, noninvasive ventilators support respiration through external means, such as masks, suitable for patients with respiratory issues who do not require invasive intervention. Both types play crucial roles in patient care, catering to varying degrees of respiratory challenges.</p></p>
