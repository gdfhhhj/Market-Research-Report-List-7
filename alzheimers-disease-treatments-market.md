<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Alzheimer`s Disease Treatments Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cholinesterase Inhibitors</li><li>NMDA Antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Alzheimer's Disease treatments market primarily features cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA antagonists. Cholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine, enhance communication between nerve cells by increasing acetylcholine levels, addressing cognitive symptoms. NMDA antagonists, like memantine, regulate glutamate activity to protect against excitotoxicity, helping with moderate to severe stages of the disease. Both types aim to improve cognitive function and slow disease progression, reflecting a combined approach to managing Alzheimer's symptoms in affected patients.</p></p>
